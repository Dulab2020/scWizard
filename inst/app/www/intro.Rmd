## **Introduction**

---

This is a web-based interactive application for further analysis of single cell data after Seurat analysis.

You can freely choose the analysis method and set the values of the parameters. After the analysis, you can also save the result data for drawing or some personalized analysis.

It is meant to provide an intuitive interface for researchers to easily upload, analyze, visualize, and explore single-cell RNA-seq data interactively with no prior programming knowledge in R.


## **Input Data Types**
